Information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Opened the input files and readed the number of players, numbers of race and, 
numbers of prints(a print means that i have to show the scoreboard).
Got every time for every player and made the points.

Game's logic
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defined a class Player which contains points and id for every player.
Defined a struct Node and a class Skiplist which will make the data structure :
skiplist.
Everytime I decide the points for a race, I delete the nodes from 
skiplist which contains the data from last race. After that, I add
the new node which will represent my new player with new data.
At a "print", I'll show the scoreboard which will contain:id, points,
and the last position from the last "print".For doing this, I'll take
the last position from the last scoreboard, by moving in it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problems
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skiplist doesn't add the same data.So, when I add a node with same data
like another one, I go on that nodeand I add after it.
When the points for 2 nodes are equal, I add by the id.
When 2 or more players have the same time, the pointsare added in order 
from their last position in the last scoreboard.
